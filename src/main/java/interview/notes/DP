The first characteristic that is common in DP problems is that the problem will ask for the optimum value (maximum or minimum) of something,
 or the number of ways there are to do something. For example:

What is the minimum cost of doing...
What is the maximum profit from...
How many ways are there to do...
What is the longest possible...
Is it possible to reach a certain point...
