There are two ways to implement DFS. 
The first one is to do recursion which you might already be familiar with. 
Here we provide a template as reference:


/*
 * Return true if there is a path from cur to target.
 */
boolean DFS(Node cur, Node target, Set<Node> visited) {
    return true if cur is target;
    for (next : each neighbor of cur) {
        if (next is not in visited) {
            add next to visted;
            return true if DFS(next, target, visited) == true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
